# dnsmasq_hosts_docker_watcher
Python-based daemon for watching docker events and update hosts file for DNSMasq.

This is Python fork of Ruby-based daemon [docker-dnsmaq](https://github.com/jaychris/docker-dnsmaq).
Using DNSMasq for lightweight service discovery with docker containers is also inspired by 
docker-log-analyzer by [zCirill](https://github.com/zCirill).
